 The Face Recognition System has made it possible to set up a smart home security through which you can decide who can enter your home using your Smartphone and web application. It's also made it simple and relatively affordable to monitor your home anytime and anywhere. The key issue in a traditional home security system is it is easily breakable and quite outdated. This in turns results in the robbery and also needs installation of the costly security system. To tackle this problem, we propose a smart home security system with face recognition enabled. In our system, the web camera is used. On motion detection camera captures an image of the person in front of the door then real-time face recognition is done. If person's image matches with one of the stored image then the details or information of the person will displayed and also alert will be raised. If an intruder is new one image of the intruder will be sent to the home owner. Using web application owner can also add new person's faces into the databases e.g. guests.
